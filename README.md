# ![Logo](icons/fb_icon_24.png) Facebook Distraction Remover


### Description
**Facebook Distraction Remover** is a Firefox add-on that declutters the Facebook experience. I got annoyed by suggested profiles and pages and got fed up to create this addon for removing them from the Facebook feed. 

With the add-on it's a bit less annoying.
